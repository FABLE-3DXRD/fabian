fabian
version XXX
Henning Osholm SÃ¸rensen & Erik Knudsen

fabian is designed for the purpose of viewing image files series. In particular
such image files obtained when doing experiments at the ESRF.

To use this you need (besides a python interpreter) the python extensions:
PIL (python imaging library) -  http://www.pythonware.com
Numeric -  http://numeric.scipy.org
pyopengl - http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net
Pmw - Python Mega Widgets -  http://pmw.sourceforge.net
Matplotlib - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net


INSTALL:

Just unpack the distribution either as
	tar xvzf fabian-XXX.tar.gz or
	unzip fabian-XXX.zip
depending on the type of package you have downloaded.

Hereafter
cd fabian-XXX and
./fabian.py

Hopefully you will get a file dialog opened at this moment.
