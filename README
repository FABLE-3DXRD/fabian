fabian is designed for the purpose of viewing image files series. In particular
such image files obtained when doing experiments at the ESRF.

To use this you need (besides a python interpreter) the python extensions:
PIL (python imaging library) -  http://www.pythonware.com
Numeric -  http://numeric.scipy.org
pyopengl - http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net
Pmw - Python Mega Widgets -  http://pmw.sourceforge.net
Matplotlib - http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net

and possibly a c compiler (neseccary for reading mar345 images).

INSTALL:

Download fabian from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=82044

Unpack the distribution either as
	tar xvzf fabian-XXX.tar.gz or
	unzip fabian-XXX.zip
depending on the type of package you have downloaded.

Hereafter:
cd fabian-XXX and
./fabian.py

or to do a proper install:
cd fabian-XXX and
python setup.py install
fabian.py

Hopefully you will get a file dialog opened at this moment.
You can also provide an image file to be opened as an argument:
fabian.py lyzo0013.edf
