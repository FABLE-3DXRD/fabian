ImAM
version 0.1
Henning Osholm SÃ¸rensen & Erik Knudsen

The ImAM is designed for the purpose of viewing image files series. In particular
such image files obtained when doing experiments at the ESRF.

To use this you need (besides a python interpreter) the python extensions:
PIL (python imaging library) - www.pythonware.com
Numeric - numeric.scipy.org
pyopengl - pyopengl.sourceforge.net

Supposedly,
python setup.py install
should do the trick for installation
